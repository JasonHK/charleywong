You can find products for the beginners to professional climbers or mountaineers, everything you need for outdoor adventures.  RC Outfitters’ high-quality products are mainly imported from Europe and the USA and they are reasonably priced. We also provides professional after-sales service. We are all one of the first outdoor company with guarantee that all purchases from RC Outfitters is “Returnable and Refundable”.\n\nRC Outfitters was established in a 300 feet office building in 2001, with very limited selections of high quality outdoor gear. However, we have tried to introduce new outdoor gear brands and provide the best sales services. After years of rapid development and the continual support from our loyal customers, RC is now one of the leading outdoor shops in Hong Kong."
